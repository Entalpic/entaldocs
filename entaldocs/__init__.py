EntalDocs CLI Tutorial
----------------------

This document provides a tutorial on how to use the ``entaldocs`` CLI tool
to initialize a Sphinx documentation project with standard ùö´ Entalpic configuration.

It also serves as a demo for how to write a Sphinx documentation project.

.. note::

    This tutorial assumes you have already installed the ``entaldocs`` package using ``pip`` or,
    preferably, ``uv``.

.. tip::

    We won't need maths here, but if you wanted to, you could use ``$`` for inline-maths: $1 + e^{i\pi} = 0$
    or ``$$`` for block-maths:
    $$ \\sum_{k=1}^{k=+\\infty} \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6} $$

.. warning::

    While you may use ``\`` (e.g. ``$\exp$``) for *inline* maths, you currently have to use ``\\``
    (e.g ``$$\\exp$$`` for block-maths. Fix welcome.

Currently ``entaldocs`` has 2 main commands:

- ``init`` to create a docs folder and get started with your current project's documentation.
- ``show-deps`` to show the dependencies that will be added to your project to make docs.

.. tip::

    Add ``-h`` / ``--help`` flags to the above commands to get their own help messages

When running ``$ entaldocs init`` the following happens:

1. Create a ``.docs/`` folder (change with ``--path``)
2. Optionally install dependencies based on an interactive user choice (use ``--deps`` to prevent prompt and install dependencies automatically)
3. Optionally use ``uv`` to install dependencies (use ``--uv`` to use ``uv`` without being asked)
4. By default, ``entaldocs`` will install the docs dependencies in the ``dev`` dependencies. Use ``--as-main`` to install them as main dependencies.
5. ``entaldoc`` then prompts the user for the project name (defaut: current directory name) and the project's URL (default: ``https`` version of the current ``git`` remote URL)

.. warning::

    ``entaldocs`` will abort if the target folder already exists. Use ``--overwrite`` to delete
    the folder if it exists before setting up the documentation.


Typical usage:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ entaldocs init --with-defaults
