EntalDocs CLI Tutorial
----------------------

This document provides a tutorial on how to use the ``entaldocs`` CLI tool to initialize
a Python project with standard ùö´ Entalpic initial setup.

It also serves as a demo for how to write a Sphinx documentation project.

.. note::

    This tutorial assumes you have already installed the ``entaldocs`` package using
    ``pip`` or, preferably, ``uv``.

TL;DR
------

Quickstart a project with uv and use local files to render the docs.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ entaldocs quickstart-project --with-defaults --local
    # Build the docs locally after you have worked on your project.
    $ entaldocs build-docs

Quickstart a project, fetch the docs boilerplate code from Github to use the most up-to-date files.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ entaldocs set-github-pat
    $ entaldocs quickstart-project


Initialize the ``docs/`` folder in an existing project.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ entaldocs init-docs # you get prompts
    $ entaldocs init-docs --with-defaults # you don't get prompts

Build the docs locally to verify your changes.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ entaldocs build-docs

Update the docs boilerplate files in your project from Github. Typically updating the brand assets and colors.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ entaldocs update

Getting Started
===============

The goal is to create a Python project with `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>`_, install the necessary
dependencies for documentation, and set up the project's documentation.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ entaldocs quickstart-project --help # typically $ entaldocs quickstart-project --with-defaults

What happens is the following:

1. A new Python project is created in the current directory using ``uv``.
2. Using ``uv add``, common development dependencies are added to the project.
3. Pre-commit hooks to format and lint the code with ``ruff`` are added.
4. The Sphinx documentation to automatically render docstrings is initialized with ``entaldocs init-docs`` to create a ``docs/`` folder
   and install the necessary dependencies for documentation.


Docs Only
=========
If you already have a Python project and want to add documentation to it, you can use
the ``entaldocs init-docs`` command.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ entaldocs init-docs --help # typically $ entaldocs init-docs --uv --with-defaults

This creates a ``docs/`` folder in your project and installing the necessary
dependencies. Some of the contents of the ``docs/`` folder are copied from the Entalpic
Github repository and therefore requires you to set a Github Personal Access Token (PAT)
to access the files.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ entaldocs set-github-pat
    $ entaldocs init-docs --uv --with-defaults

Going further
=============

Currently ``entaldocs`` has 6 main commands:

- ``quickstart-project`` to create a new Python project with ``uv`` and set up
  documentation as per ``init``.
- ``init-docs`` to create a docs folder and get started with your current project's
  documentation.
- ``build-docs`` to build the HTML documentation locally (equivalent to running
  ``make clean && make html`` in the docs folder).
- ``update`` to update the documentation boilerplate files in your project from Github. Typically updating the brand assets and colors.
- ``set-github-pat`` to set your Github Personal Access Token (PAT) to access remote
  files.
- ``show-deps`` to show the dependencies that will be added to your project to make
  docs.

.. tip::

    Add ``-h`` / ``--help`` flags to the above commands to get their own help messages

.. note::

    ``init-docs`` and ``update`` require a Github Personal Access Token (PAT) to
    access remote files. You can set it with ``$ entaldocs set-github-pat``. Alternatively,
    you can use the ``--local`` flag to use local files instead of fetching from Github.
    Note that it may therefore not use the most up-to-date files to render the docs.

When running ``$ entaldocs init-docs`` the following happens:

1. Create a ``docs/`` folder (change with ``--path``)
2. Optionally install dependencies based on an interactive user choice (use ``--deps``
   to prevent prompt and install dependencies automatically)
3. Optionally use ``uv`` to install dependencies (use ``--uv`` to use ``uv`` without
   being asked)
4. By default, ``entaldocs`` will install the docs dependencies in the ``dev``
   dependencies. Use ``--as-main`` to install them as main dependencies.
5. ``entaldoc`` then prompts the user for the project name (default: current directory
   name) and the project's URL (default: ``https`` version of the current ``git`` remote
   URL)

.. warning::

    ``entaldocs`` will abort if the target folder already exists. Use ``--overwrite`` to
    delete the folder if it exists before setting up the documentation.


.. tip::

    We won't need maths here, but if you wanted to, you could use ``$`` for
    inline-maths: $1 + e^{i\pi} = 0$ or ``$$`` for block-maths:
    $$
    \sum_{k=1}^{k=+\infty} \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
    $$

.. important::

    Remember to use **raw** strings when you use maths: ``r"$1 + e^{i\pi} = 0$"`` or

    .. code-block:: python

        r'''
        $$
        1 + e^{i\pi} = 0
        $$
