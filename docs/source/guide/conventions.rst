TL;DR
~~~~~

Use `Ruff <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/>`_ and associated `Ruff VSCode Extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff>`_ to:

- Format your code (Black-compatible)
- Sort your imports (isort-compatible)
- Lint your code (Flake8-compatible)

.. code-block:: bash

    uv add --dev ruff
    # or
    pip install ruff
    # then:
    ruff check  # lint
    ruff format path/to/file.py  # format
    ruff format path/to/folder/  # format

.. tip::

    `Set your default formatter <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/formatting#_set-a-default-formatter>`_ to ``Ruff`` then enable `Format on save <https://stackoverflow.com/a/54665086/3867406>`_ in VSCode not to think about it.

In the following section we'll describe how popular formatters / linters / sorters work, keeping in mind this is all bundled (and extended) in **Ruff**.

Formatting with Black
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    Understanding ``black`` is important because it is an industry standard. 
    It is also the `foundation for Ruff <https://astral.sh/blog/the-ruff-formatter#2-black-compatible>`_

Black is a code formatter. It ensures we all write code in the same style.

For instance, this is valid Python code:

.. code-block:: python

    a=32000
    b = {
    'a': 1, "b":2,}
    function (a=1,b = [1,2,3],c=3,)

Black will reformat it to:

.. code-block:: python

    a = 32000
    b = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
    function(a=1, b=[1, 2, 3], c=3)

Some choices are optimized for readability (for instance single quotes are replaced by double quotes). Others are just a matter of subjective taste (for instance the number of spaces around the equal sign).

That being said, what matters is the consistency. Black is a tool that ensures we all write code in the same style. This will also make PRs clearer, easier to review, and less prone to conflicts. Plus, it will save you time: you don't have to think about formatting anymore, Black does it for you.

There are a number of ways to work with Black. It can be an extension in your IDE (PyCharm, VSCode, etc.), a pre-commit hook, or a command line tool. The latter is the simplest to set up and use:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install black
    black path/to/file.py

Black will reformat the file in place. If you want to see the changes before applying them, use the ``--diff`` flag.

.. caution::

    Your file needs to be valid Python for ``black`` to run. If you have a Syntax Error in your code, ``black`` will fail and it may look like your IDE extension "is not working". It is trying to, but it cannot. Fix the Syntax Error first, then run ``black`` again.

Check out the `Black documentation <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for more information.

Flake8
~~~~~~

Flake8 is a code linter. It will help you, just like ``black``, with writing good, consistent code. 
It will also help you avoid common pitfalls and mistakes like undefined variables, unused imports, etc.
Linters are most commonly used in one of two ways:

1. Provide feedback as you code in your IDE through extensions to warn you about potential issues.
2. As a Continuous Integration tool to ensure that all code is compliant with the rules.

.. note::

    Understanding ``flake8`` is important because it is also an industry standard. 
    Ruff goes a step further by extending Flake8 with additional rules and being more consistent.
    `Goodbye to Flake8 and PyLint: faster linting with Ruff <https://pythonspeed.com/articles/pylint-flake8-ruff/>`_


E.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    # example1.py
    def f(myvar):
        return myva * 2

.. code-block:: bash

    flake8 example1.py
    example1.py:2:12: F821 undefined name 'myva'

Flake8 is a command line tool. It can be installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install flake8
    flake8 --max-line-length=88 --ignore=E203 path/to/file.py


.. note::

        For ``flake8`` to play nicely with ``black``, you need to use a couple extra flags:

        .. code-block:: bash

            flake8 --max-line-length=88 --ignore=E203 path/to/file.py

        ``--max-line-length=88`` is to match ``black``'s default line length.

        ``--ignore=E203`` is to avoid conflicts between ``black`` and ``flake8``. ``black`` will add a space before ``:`` in slices, ``flake8`` will complain about it. This flag tells ``flake8`` to ignore this particular error.

.. important::

    This is important in case you work on a project that isn't Entalpic-lead and does not use Ruff as formatter+linter.
    Hoever, in Entalpic projects, you should use Ruff, which lints and formats in a consistent way and you don't have to
    worry about such flags to make the linter and formatter play nicely together.

Most IDEs will also let you use Flake8 as an extension to have feedback as you code. Ask Google about your particular IDE, you're very likely not the first one.

Check out the `Flake8 documentation <https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`_ for more information.

Isort
~~~~~

Isort is a tool that sorts your imports. It will make sure that:

-   standard library imports are on top
-   third-party imports are in the middle
-   local imports are at the bottom

It will also sort the imports alphabetically, and group them by package.

.. note::

    Once again, understanding ``isort`` is important because it is yet another industry standard.
    But Ruff does it well, so you don't have to worry about it if you use Ruff in your project.

.. code-block:: python

    from os.path import expandvars, relpath
    from entaldocs.logger import Logger
    from pathlib import Path
    import json
    from rich import print
    from subprocess import run
    from shutil import copytree

Becomes:

.. code-block:: python

    import json
    from os.path import expandvars, relpath
    from pathlib import Path
    from shutil import copytree
    from subprocess import run

    from rich import print

    from entaldocs.logger import Logger

Isort can be installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install isort
    isort path/to/file.py

Again, this is all configurable. You can read more about it in the `isort documentation <https://pycqa.github.io/isort/>`_.

    The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit. (*)
    Simple is better than complex. (*)
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts. (*)
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. (*)
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. (*)
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

What the Fuck Python??
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We cannot emphasize enough you have a regular look at this repo: `What the f*ck Python! ðŸ˜± <https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython>`_.

Typically, you should be able to explain:

.. code-block:: python

    assert False == False in [False] # this is True. Why?

Or

.. code-block:: python

    some_string = "wtf"
    some_dict = {}
    for i, some_dict[i] in enumerate(some_string):
        i = 10
    else:
        some_dict[i] = "!"

    assert some_dict == {0: "w", 1: "t", 2: "f", 10: "!"}
