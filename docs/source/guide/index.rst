Documentation At Entalpic
=========================

*Documentation* refers to the content that you produce to help others understand your code. 

It includes both the code's *docstrings* and the *manual documentation files* like the current one you are reading.

.. admonition:: Docstrings TL-DR
    :class: tip

    Use `Numpy-style <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_ docstrings as illustrated in this :ref:`write docstrings-extended`.

    :doc:`write-docstrings` contains a guide on how to write docstrings in particular (which requires basic understanding of reStructuredText).

.. admonition:: Manual documentation files TL-DR
    :class: hint
    
    Use `reStructuredText <https://shibuya.lepture.com/writing/>`_ to write your manual documentation files.
